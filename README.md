# screencast.sh

Record part of your screen in WEBM`*` and (optionally) upload it.

## Requirements
 - `ffmpeg` (video recording)
 - `key-mon` (for keyboard demonstration)
 - `zenity` (*optional*, upload prompts)
 
## Configuration

Please change target file location

## Usage

1. Run once to start recording
2. Run again to stop

I find it handy just to bind it to a key.

`*` is is being recorded in lossless `AVI` and then converted to `WEBM`
